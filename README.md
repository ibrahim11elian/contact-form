# Frontend Mentor - Contact Form Solution

![Design preview for the Contact form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution for the contact form challenge by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out a contact form and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Accessibility was a key focus for this form. The challenge was to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission.
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed.
  - The email address is not formatted correctly.
- Complete the form only using the keyboard.
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
